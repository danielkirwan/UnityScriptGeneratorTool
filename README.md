# UnityScriptGeneratorTool

This tool was created to improve the creation of C# scripts inside of the Unity game engine. 

The main focus of this is that you can create derived classes with the parent class attached. 
The other main benefit of the tool is so that you can create scriptable objects and not have to manually create all the extra bits you need to make sure it is usable. Usually you would need to create a C# script first and then edit the script, but with this tool you can do it all in the editor window.

Let me know any features you would like in the tool and feel free to update the respository with updates.

Happy coding.
